The project “Food and Me” aims to help users choosing the right food according to their needs. “Food and me” is based on open food dataset, an open access database on information about barcoded food products sold in Switzerland. Users of “Food and Me” application would be able to:

    Select the list of ingredients they want to avoid. This list of ingredient is taken from openfoodfacts
    Identify the product using its barcode. The barcode may be scanned, written manually, or searched.

Depending on the ingredients of the product identified “food and Me” notifies the users if they can consume or not this product. The users may ask for alternative products.

This is an open source project, source code is available on Github: github.com/foodandme/foodandme
